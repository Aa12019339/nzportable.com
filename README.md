# Nazi Zombies: Portable

# About
This is the main/hub repository for NZ:P, the Call of Duty: Zombies de-make powered by various enhanced forks of the Quake engine, and has been in development since 2009. The main purpose of this hub repository is to serve as a place to host nightly builds as well as a means of bug reporting on a game-wide (non-component) scale.

The game itself is *mostly* feature-equivalent with Call of Duty: World at War on a generic level. Gameplay components are implemented, with some parity differences, but most World at War maps and their gimmicks are not yet represented. Various small features from Call of Duty: Black Ops are present, but not on as wide of a scale as compared to World at War.

Oh yeah, we have lots of bugs, too.
